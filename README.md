# What Is Symbiosis?

From the [original documentation](documentation/Symbiosis%20Documentation.txt):
> Symbiosis is a developer tool for adapting Mac OS X VST plug-ins to the Audio Unit (AU) standard. It essentially
consists of a single C++ file that you can compile into your VST project to make the plug-in compatible with the
Audio Unit protocol. Optionally, you may choose to use a pre-built "wrapper plug-in" for adapting your existing VST
plug-in to the AU standard without even having to recompile any source code.

# History

Symbiosis was developed and open-sourced by Magnus Lidstr√∂m of [Sonic Charge](http://soniccharge.com/) fame.
It was originally hosted on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/symbiosis-au-vst) but doesn't appear to have
been actively maintained for some time now (the last commit by Magnus was on April 22, 2013). With the closure
of Google Code, the question was asked on the Symbiosis mailing list / group whether the official repository
would move, but there was no response from Magnus. In the meantime, several people have imported the [Symbiosis
Google Code repository](https://code.google.com/p/symbiosis-au-vst) into GitHub.
This is a fork of one of those imports.
